## 📜 Core Audience Contract <a name="audience-contract"></a>

Wirekrak Core is designed for infrastructure and systems engineers who require explicit control over protocol behavior, lifecycle, and correctness.

Core exposes exchange-specific semantics and low-level abstractions, prioritizing transparency, performance, and correctness over convenience. Users of Core are expected to reason about failure modes, lifecycle transitions, and protocol details. The responsibilities, guarantees, and evolution principles of Core are formally defined in the Core Audience Contract.
