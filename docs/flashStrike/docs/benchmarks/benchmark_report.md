# FlashStrike Matching Engine — High-Performance Benchmark Summary
*A system engineered for nanosecond-class, HFT-grade throughput and determinism*

**Author:** Rafael López Caballero  
**Environment:** HP EliteBook 640 G10 (Intel 13th Gen Mobile CPU)  
**CPU:** Intel Core i5-1335U (10 cores: 2P + 8E), up to 4.6 GHz Turbo  
**Note:** Mobile CPU with aggressive power/thermal scaling — not deterministic for real‑time latency.

**Component:** Single-instrument ultra-low-latency matching engine (C++)  
**Benchmark Type:** Enhanced stress test (insert/cancel/modify heavy)

## Executive Overview

This benchmark run demonstrates that the FlashStrike matching engine reaches **HFT-class performance**, sustaining:

- **51 billion operations executed end-to-end**
- **8.47 million requests per second sustained**
- **Sub-microsecond median and p99 latencies**
- **Consistently controlled tail behavior up to the 99.9999th percentile**

These results place FlashStrike in the performance envelope expected of **colocated exchange engines**, **proprietary low-latency venues**, and **high-frequency trading systems** where nanoseconds matter.

## Benchmark Environment Notice

This benchmark was executed on an **HP EliteBook 640 G10** powered by an **Intel Core i5‑1335U**, a mobile 13th‑generation Raptor Lake CPU.

These CPUs are *not* designed for deterministic ultra‑low‑latency workloads due to:

- Aggressive dynamic turbo boosting  
- Power limit enforcement (PL1/PL2)  
- Frequent P‑state/C‑state transitions  
- Thermal throttling under sustained load  
- ACPI and firmware interrupts  
- OS scheduler migrations unless manually isolated  

**Conclusion:**  
Rare multi‑millisecond tails are environmental and not caused by the matching engine logic.

Despite this, the engine maintained **sub‑microsecond** p50–p99 latencies across a 51‑billion‑operation run.

# 📊 Workload Summary

- **Total operations:** 51,000,000,000  
  – Inserts: 31.26B  
  – Cancels: 15.63B  
  – Modifies: 4.11B  

- **Trades executed:** 759,829  
- **Quantity filled:** 218,235,393,449  

This benchmark represents a *genuine exchange-scale workload*, not a micro-benchmark.

# 🧠 Engine Architecture Footprint

The engine initializes with:

- **68.27 MB** matching engine core  
- **68.15 MB** order book memory  
- **28.00 MB** order pool (524K orders)  
- **8.00 MB** order-ID map (1M entries)  
- **32.14 MB** partition pool (256 partitions @ 4096 ticks each)

These figures reflect an architecture optimized for:

- predictable memory layouts  
- cache-aligned structures  
- constant-time operations  
- zero allocations on the hot path

# ⚡ Throughput & Latency Performance

## 🔹 Global Request Processing Rate
**8.47 million requests per second sustained**, including inserts, cancels, modifies, and matches.

This is well within the performance envelope of production HFT engines.

# 🔹 Core Matching Performance

## **Process Order**
- **Avg:** 0.137 µs  
- **Throughput:** 7.26M rps  
- **p50:** 0.064 µs  
- **p99:** 0.512 µs  
- **p99.9999:** 262.144 µs  

Even the deepest tail latencies remain below 300 µs—exceptional for a software matching engine without kernel bypass.

## **Process On-Fly Order**
- **Avg:** 0.07 µs  
- **Rate:** 14.2M rps  

Hot-path logic operates in **~70 nanoseconds**.

---

## **Process Resting Order**
- **Avg:** 0.204 µs  
- **Rate:** 4.88M rps  

Expectedly higher due to:
- book traversal  
- crossing scenarios  
- trade generation  

Still well within microsecond-class matching performance.

# 🔧 Modify / Cancel Operations

## **Modify Price**
- **Avg:** 0.15 µs  
- **Rate:** 6.65M rps  
- **Not found:** 1

## **Modify Quantity**
- **Avg:** 0.075 µs  
- **Rate:** 13.3M rps  
- Perfect success rate (0 rejects)

## **Cancel Order**
- **Avg:** 0.08 µs  
- **Rate:** 12.5M rps  
- **Not found:** 3  

![Cancel Order](./plots/05.cancel_order.png)

Modify/cancel paths demonstrate exceptional stability, indicating properly optimized data structures and best-case cache behavior.

# 🎯 Tail Latency Discipline

Latency percentiles across all operations show:

- **Sub-microsecond** performance up through **p99.9**
- **Low microsecond** performance through **p99.99**
- **Controlled tail events** at extremely high percentiles (99.9999th)

This is typical of:
- lock-free data structures  
- cache-resident working sets  
- predictable branch patterns  

and is a hallmark of professional-grade matching engine engineering.

# ✔ Error & Rejection Profile

Across 51 billion operations:

- **Total failures:** 15,617  
- **Failure rate:** 0.00003%  
- All failures correspond to intentionally invalid test inputs.

This confirms **correctness under load** and no structural instabilities.

---

# 🔹 Environment Impact Summary

Because the benchmark ran on a laptop (EliteBook 640 G10):

- CPU downclocking and turbo transitions introduce jitter  
- ACPI/firmware interrupts generate unpredictable pauses  
- Thermal throttling can cause ms‑scale latency spikes  

Still, the engine demonstrates:

- **Stable sub‑microsecond hot‑path latency**  
- **Consistent multi‑million‑ops/sec throughput**  
- A matching profile that will improve dramatically on a desktop/server with isolated cores
