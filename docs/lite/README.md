## 📜 Lite Audience Contract <a name="audience-contract"></a>

**Wirekrak Lite** is designed for application developers and data consumers who want access to domain-level market data without dealing with protocol mechanics or infrastructure concerns.

Lite provides a minimal, conservative, exchange-agnostic API with safe defaults and explicitly limited guarantees. It deliberately restricts access to low-level concepts in order to reduce cognitive load and misuse. The scope, guarantees, and limitations of Lite are formally defined in the Lite Audience Contract.

## 🔒 Public API Stability <a name="api-stability"></a>

**Wirekrak Lite** follows a strict public API stability policy. All symbols exposed through the Lite public surface are guaranteed to remain source- and binary-compatible within the same major version.

This document defines exactly which parts of the Lite API are stable, what evolution is allowed, and what is explicitly *not* guaranteed.
